Environmental requirement:
C++ compiler that can compile C++ 11 standard , gcc version 5.4.0 
Linux OS, Ubuntu 16.04 


Two separate programs - txblk and wallet 
Two separate tar files - txblk.tar and wallet.tar

Steps to run,

1. Extract the given txblk.tar and wallet.tar file using "tar -xvf txblk.tar" and "tar -xvf wallet.tar"
2. Change directory to txblk or wallet
3. Run makefile using "make all" command and this will compile and install the txblk or wallet executable accordingly


For cyrpto operations, all public and private key files are expected to be within "txblk" and "wallet" folders
Keys given for Alice and Bob (public and private) are present in both the folders (Ex - alicepubli_key.pem, aliceprivate_key.pem)
Sample test files are also present
For txblk, test4.txt
For wallet, test5.txt
